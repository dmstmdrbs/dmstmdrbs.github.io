## PINF !! 
Unlike Ethernet-based TCP/IP, which transmits data through multiple layer stacks, InfiniBand takes a method of directly communiticating data through HCA. Although InfiniBand has features of low latency and high bandwidth, due to its characteristics of operating asynchronously, it makes a big difference in latency of the entire program depending on the process.
In this paper, in order to improve the latency of the communication layer using InfiniBand, we present PinF, a model that optimizes the method of processing work completion of InfiniBand.
